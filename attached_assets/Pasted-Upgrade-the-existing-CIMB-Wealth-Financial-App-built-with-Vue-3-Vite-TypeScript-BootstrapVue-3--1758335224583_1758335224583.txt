Upgrade the existing "CIMB Wealth Financial App" built with Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, BootstrapVue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, AG-Grid, Chart.js, and Three.js.

Focus: Improve UX/UI design with modern financial dashboard aesthetics.

Design Goals:
- Use **CIMB branding** (deep red, burgundy gradients, white, neutral grays).
- Apply **glassmorphism** for cards and panels (blurred backgrounds, frosted glass look).
- Add **micro-interactions** with Vue transitions and hover animations.
- Ensure **dark/light mode toggle** is polished with smooth theme switching.
- Enhance **mobile UX** with:
  - Floating Action Button (FAB) for quick actions (e.g., Add Goal, Export Report).
  - Collapsible sidebar and swipe gestures for transactions.
- Dashboard widgets should look **dynamic and modular**:
  - Net worth card with animated counter.
  - Portfolio donut chart with center value overlay.
  - Market ticker bar (dummy stock prices scrolling horizontally).
- Portfolio & Transactions:
  - Compact/dense toggle in AG-Grid for more/less detail.
  - Smooth hover highlights on rows.
- Goals Page:
  - Circular progress bars with animated radial filling.
  - Gamification badges (e.g., "50% Goal Achieved").
- Reports Page:
  - Polished export buttons (CSV/PDF) with icons.
  - Use cards for different report sections.
- 3D Wealth Visualization:
  - Improve aesthetics with a gradient background and soft camera transitions.
  - Animate wealth growth bars with easing effects.

Project Requirements:
- Keep existing features (Login, Dashboard, Portfolio, Transactions, Goals, Reports, 3D Visualization).
- Apply **global theme styles** (variables for colors, shadows, blur).
- Create a `/theme` utility to manage colors, gradients, shadows.
- Implement **Vue transitions** for:
  - Page navigation
  - Card mount/unmount
  - Chart updates
- Ensure responsive design for desktop, tablet, mobile.
- Add **modern typography** (Google Fonts: Inter or Poppins).
- Optimize accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

Deliverables:
- Updated Vue components with modern UI.
- New CSS/SCSS theme file with glassmorphism & gradients.
- Smooth animations for dashboard cards, charts, and tables.
- Floating Action Button with action menu.
- Market ticker dummy component.
- Updated README with design system notes.

- `bootstrap-vue-3`
- `vueuse` (for dark mode toggling and utilities)
- `@vueuse/motion` or `vue3-transitions` (for animations)
- `@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome` (icons)
